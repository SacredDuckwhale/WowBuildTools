	Implemented modules:
	* Locales (mostly functionable)
	* StaticAnalysis (basic syntax check only)
	* UnitTesting (basic luaunit support with somewhat specific structural requirement)
	
	Synopsis:
	WBT is a simple program (barely more than a script at the point of writing) that serves as a shortcut; a more convenient way to integrate changes successfully and deploy Lua-based addons for World of Warcraft with confidence. It also helps with common tasks resembling project management chores that aren't covered by existing tools and commonly neglected by addon authors.
	
	It is written completely in Lua, as most addon authors will be somewhat familiar with it.
